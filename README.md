Monte Carlo Final Project Report

Maria Liu


Synopsis: The monte carlo project was meant to focus on coding based on certain statisically predictiable outcomes and testing us on how to manipulate the results to change those probabilities. A fair coin should have a fifty-fifty chance on landing on either side (even though in real life this is a hoax with physical coins being asymmetrical). Computers allow further exploration of weighing on side or the other more and seeing the results that come of it in fairly neatly packaged graphs and tables.


Die Class

A die with a number (n) faces, and a corresponding weight(w).
Input the number of faces, their weights, and how many times to roll.



Game Class

This class rolls a specified number of times, while recording of each roll to a dataframe and keeping the latest results. 



Analyzer Class

Computes stats of one game round, such as the the frequency of each die result and die face combinations. 
Checks the faces of the die when rolls, keeps track of when they are all of the same face, and the different combinations and frequencies of faces displayed for all the rolls.
